# Netflix Clone Project

## Overview

Welcome to my Netflix Clone project! This project is a front-end replica of the Netflix homepage, created using HTML and CSS. The goal was to practice and demonstrate skills in web development, focusing on responsive design and mimicking the look and feel of the original Netflix website.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The layout adjusts seamlessly across various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Interactive Elements:** Includes hover effects and a navigation bar similar to Netflix, enhancing the user experience.
- **Pixel-perfect Styling:** Attention to detail to replicate the design of Netflix as closely as possible.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For structuring the content.
- **CSS3:** For styling the webpage, including Flexbox and Grid for layout and media queries for responsiveness.


## Getting Started

To view this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/red0074/netflix.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd netflix-clone
    ```
3. **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser:**
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

## Challenges and Learnings

This project presented several challenges, particularly in ensuring the design is fully responsive and closely mimics the original Netflix layout. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of CSS Flexbox and Grid, and improved my ability to write clean, maintainable code.

## Future Improvements

- **JavaScript Integration:** Adding JavaScript to enhance interactivity, such as carousel sliders and modal pop-ups.
- **Backend Integration:** Integrating a backend to fetch real data and make the project dynamic.
